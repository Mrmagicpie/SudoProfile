Hey there, this is the settings I use for my sudo user. Feel free to take a look around. :D

## How to use:

### Option 1:

Use this handy script I provided [here](https://sudo.mrmagicpie.xyz/setup.sh), run this as **sudo**.

### Option 2:

Use the following commands to setup manually.

```
cd ~
```

```
git clone https://github.com/Mrmagicpie/SudoProfile
```

```
rm .bashrc
```

```
mv SudoProfile/.bashrc ./.bashrc
```

Then you're done!
